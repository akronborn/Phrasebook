Created as tool for use by TriLegion users. TriLegion is a 3x3x3 intensive language study system, where learners commit to at least 3 study sessions a week for 3 months at 30 minutes minimum per session with their language partner. Afterwards, they can continue, find another partner, or move on to another language, but they're committed to completing the 90 days. 
TriLegion launch: February 2020. 

This site will allow users to quickly create on-the-fly audio files to create custom phrasebooks, while or after speaking with their language partners. Automatic deletion has been removed, so that the text is not deleted on submission. This will allow users to make a quick translation into their native or another 2nd language, to practice the words and phrases in both directions. By simply changing the 2 character language input, translating the text, and pressing submit, again, a 2nd audio file is created. 

Ex:
Text: Cxi tiu estas la lasta fojo.
Language: eo
Filename: LastEO
File created: LastEO.mp3


Text: This is the last time.
Language: en
Filename: LastEN
File Created: LastEN.mp3
